                <h1><strong>Subjects of Study </strong></h1>
                <p>At the Awesome science faculty, We have a pretty open-minded research facility- as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.You seems like an intelligent,dedicated researcher,and just the kind person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order to priority:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Turning H2O into wine,and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C14H12O3)</li>
                            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30°C(86°F),When the audience size exponentially increases(effects of 3 x1000>3 x 10000.)</li>
                            <li><em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take,required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?Thanks.

                <h1><strong>Exotic dance moves</strong></h1>
                <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work,<i>I did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To anwser your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
                        <h2>Polynesian chiken dance</h2>
                        <p>a little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as <strong>300BC</strong>, a whole village  would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</p>
                        <h2>Icelandie brownian shuffle</h2>
                        <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</p>
                        <h2>Arctic robot dance</h2>
                        <p>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explores in the 1960s believed to have discoverda new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discivered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</p>

                        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
